    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon if using, and baking soda.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter,
            sugar, and honey on medium-high until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low, add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and stopping to scrape
            down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla until just combined.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low, gradually add in the flour mixture, beating just until combined</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a lightly greased 9-inch round cake pan lined at the bottom with parchment, smoothing
            the batter into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes. If desired, you can sprinkle the top with almonds after 20 minutes of baking. Loosely
            cover the cake with foil at any time if the top or almonds start to get too brown. Let the cake cool in the
            pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Serve warm, drizzled with additional honey.</li>
    </ol>
